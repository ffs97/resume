	{Software Engineer 3}
    {Sunnyvale, CA}
	{Jan 2022 --- Present}
	{%
		\begin{cvitems}
            \item Working on building express data infrastructure offering with the Napa team for internal Google clients.
            \item Presently leading the GA launch of date partitioned tables, which involved improving the insert latency by 20x and stabilizing the existing architecture.
            \item Designed and implemented scalability fixes to improve write latency by eliminating contention in our metadata servers, requriing detailed investigation into underlying dependencies.
            \item Led a multi-quarter migration effort of inactive tables off a deprecated system by building a shadow infrastructure and seemlessly migrating millions of tables with no external user impact.
            \item Greatly contributed to production stability, especially by mentoring many folks and onboarding them to standard production principles, effectively reducing the daily toil for the team's oncall rotations.

	{MTS II - Machine Learning Engineer}
    {San Jose, CA (Remote)}
	{Mar 2021 --- Jan 2022}
	{%
		\begin{cvitems}
            \item Designed and planned AWS infrastructure for distributed processing of events in file servers based on SQS, Batch, and Lambdas
            \item Laid out the foundation for ML-based service offerings in public cloud and drove the development of models for anomaly detection

	{Machine Learning Engineering Intern}
    {}
	{May 2020 --- Aug 2020}
	{%
		\begin{cvitems}
            \item The objective was to implement robust Machine Learning models for anomaly detection in operations performed on large file servers
            \item Built a variant of the Holt-Winters Model for temporal based anomaly detection on per hour operation counts with adaptive thresholding
            \item Implemented and used Collaborative Filtering for detection by learning user behavior using peer comparison for file access patterns

	{Summer Analyst}
	{Bangalore, India}
	{May 2018 --- Jul 2018}
	{%
		\begin{cvitems}
            \item Built a greedy strategy for customer margin allocation, providing an alternative to the existing logic with 97\% runtime improvement
            \item Introduced changes in existing models for asset-liability (AL) gap management identifying bugs in pre-existing code and augmenting features for proper AL gap management for deposits and clearinghouse initial margin

        \begin{cvitems}
            \item Extracted image features from Ad creative images using OpenCV (in python) and Google Cloud Vision API to explain ad CTR
            \item Analyzed correlations, performed regression tests, and used variable selection using Weka to detect explainable features
        \end{cvitems}
